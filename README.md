# Report

## Introduction
In this project, we try to use photos of streets to find some sociological information using machine learning methods. For example, the relationship between the number of cars in the street and the average value of property in the street, and we also have some other hypotheses, such as whether the percentage of Japanese cars in the street is related to the average education level in that street.

## Timeline

 
### Gather Information: Week1-2

### Data Collection and Analysis: Week 3-4

### Modeling: Week5


## Methodology

### data collection

intro: FIPS Place Codes: Used to identify cities, towns, and villages in the United States. These codes are essential for describing and analyzing geographic location information in census data.

Image sourceï¼šGoogle Street View API

Number of pictures: 20000

Number of FIPS: 200 randomly 

Number of images per FIPS: 100


### data analysis and cleaning 

intro:For all the downloaded street maps, use the API to recognize vehicles, including the number, brand, types, and series.The recognized data is stored in a database and output to a csv table after performing relevant statistical operations, including counting information such as the number of vehicles in a fips area.

Step1:use API

API: tecentcloudapi

Step2:store data in database

Database: MySQL
<div style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="./asset/database.jpg" alt="api">
</div>

Step3:

</div>

Step4:output
<div style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="./asset/csv.jpg" alt="api">
</div>




## Modeling 
After seeking and analyzing the dataset,we try to use univariate regression and multivariable regression to discover the relationship of the amount and type of the vehicles and the median property of the certain area.

## Conclusion 



## Reference 

1. Using deep learning and Google Street View to estimate the demographic makeup of neighborhoods across the United States
2. Combining satellite imagery and machine learning to predict poverty
3. Deep hybrid models with urban imagery
4. Learning representations of satellite imagery by leveraging point of interests
