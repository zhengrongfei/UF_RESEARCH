## Introduction
In this project, we try to use photos of streets to find some sociological information using machine learning methods. For example, the relationship between the number of cars in the street and the average value of property in the street, and we also have some other hypotheses, such as whether the percentage of Japanese cars in the street is related to the average education level in that street.
